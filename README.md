Me playing around with *learnyounode*.

Useful for playing around and getting familiar with how to work with code in node. But does a
poor job of providing context for what it is this would be used for in a project.

Node documentation makes me want to pull hair out lol. Maybe someday I'll come across
documentation written for human beings. Until then I'll do my best not to stray too far
from the pool of optimism.

Recommend working up to lesson 10, warning you may have to struggle a little to get there.
Don't expect much explanation as to why you are doing any of these exercises.  :(
